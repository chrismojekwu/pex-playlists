# Pex Playlist Submission
My goal for this submission was to create a responsive application that displays songs according to 3 supplied moods.

Foremost I wanted to make sure the songs were categorized well so I listened to the first 100 songs on the playlist and categorized them. I tried to stay as neutral as possible but the data is biased. 

After completing my review of the songs, I used Javascript to average the values of the provided attributes of the songs in each playlist. 

I also calculated a 3 part range of the values and used that data to find a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd rank for the playlists.

I found out that not many songs met the average standards so I tuned the values based on the collected numbers and mood defining songs.

In terms of the presentation of the data, I used HTML & CSS alongside JSX & Javascript to create a dynamic single-page interface for the user that retains its core functionality on mobile.

## Features
- A user can view the songs on separate playlists.

- Each playlist contains an informational modal with its rank in the collected attributes.

- A user can view a specific song's attribute percentage which is based on the collected ranges.

- A user can create a playlist, which will receive a percentage value and be categorized.


### Tech Used
React, Javascript, HTML, CSS

### Future Updates..

- Research: I would like to learn more about the attributes of songs, in my opinion...based on my opinion they seemed pretty accurate. Outside of loudness, and tempo all the other attributes were derived from multiple features. 

- Componentization: My approach consists of 4 components and utility functions that could be improved for reusability and performance. 

- Testing: The website is not fully tested. I would have liked to dive deeper into the testing and also test all the utility functions.

- Music: I think an interesting next step would be to have some music streaming. 

- User Song Ratings: It would be great to have users categorize songs and collect the values. I also think it would be really interesting to see what friends feel when they listen to a song.
